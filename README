Psaltiki Toolkit for Gamera
===========================

-------

This toolkit is for the optical recognition of Byzantine chant ("Psaltiki")
notation. From the wide variety of notation forms, we focus on the
notational system developed in the 19th century in Constaninople, aka
"Contemporary Psaltiki Notation".

The toolkit provides: 

 - a GUI based script for training psaltiki images
 - a script for recognizing psaltiki images
