Psaltiki Toolkit User's Manual
==============================

This documentation is for those, who want to use the toolkit for psaltiki
recognition, but are not interested in extending its capabilities. If you
want to write custom recognition scripts, see the `developer's manual`__.

.. __: developermanual.html


Overview
''''''''

As each historic psaltiki print uses different neume symbols, you
must first train the system with some pages of music and then
use this training data for subsequent recognition:

.. image:: images/overview.png

Hence the proper use of this toolkit requires two steps:

- training of the neume symbols on representative music images.
  This step is interactive.
- recognize other psaltiki images with the aid of this training data.
  This step usually runs automatically without user interaction.

Prerequisites
-------------

The recognition assumes that the page layout is in a single column.
If you have scanned in to adjacent pages into a single image, resulting
in a two column layout, you must first split the image into two.

As automatic lyrics removal is not yet imlemented, you must currently
also remove the lyrics from the image. this is however necessary only for
the recognition step, but not strictly for the training step, because
you can simply ignore all lyrics during training.


Training
''''''''

Starting the Training Dialog
----------------------------

The training dialog is started from the Gamera GUI:

- import the Psaltiki toolkit with 
  *Toolkits/psaltiki/Import 'psaltiki' toolkit*. This will create an
  icon named *psaltiki* in the object list of the Gamera GUI.
- right click on the psaltiki icon and select the menu
  *Train Neumes from Image*.

.. image:: images/training1.png

Gamera will prompt you for an image file and the following additional
parameter:

  - an optional training database file (in *.xml* format). For the first
    page this will be left empty; for the following pages of the same
    print it will be the file containing the traing data of the previous
    pages.
  - on optional file containing all symbol names, one symbol name per line.
    When empty, a default symbol table is used.
  - preprocessing options as described in the next section.

.. image:: images/training2.png

After pressing *Ok*, the training GUI shown above will appear that is 
described in
detail in the Gamera training tutorial. See the section `Symbol Names`__ for
details about the neume naming conventions and how to train uninteresting
stuff. When you have trained the loaded
page, save the training data with 
*File/Classifier glyphs/Save glyphs in classifier...* in an *.xml* file.

.. __: usermanual.html#symbol-names

.. note:: Do not train lyrics, but only neumes. There is currently
          no support for lyrics recognition in the toolkit.

Preprocessing
-------------

Common image defects like black speckles, small white holes, black copy
borders or rotation can be improved with the preprocessing routines
`smooth`_, `remove_copy_border`_ and `correct_rotation`_. In particular
the *smooth* plugin does not necessarily improve the image quality, because
its filling of white holes can inadvertantly join separate neumes.

Thus you should always test the optimal preprocessing options for each
print, which can be done by loading the image into the Gamera GUI, converting
it to Onebit (*Conversion/to_onebit* in the image right click menu) and
starting the preprocessing plugins from the *Psaltiki/Preprocessing*
right click menu.

.. _`smooth`: psaltiki.html#smooth
.. _`remove_copy_border`: psaltiki.html#remove-copy-border
.. _`correct_rotation`: psaltiki.html#correct-rotation

.. note:: Whatever your choice of preprocessing routines is,
          make sure you use the same preprocessing for both training
          and recognition.

Symbol Names
------------

The toolkit allows for arbitrary neume names. This leads however to the
problem how the recognition system can identify certain neumes that are 
crucial for the semantic interpretation. To solve this paradoxon, we
require that the symbol names consist of period delimited strings, as in

   ``primary.baseline.oligon``

When any of these strings is one of a set of predefined keywords,
the neume has the meaning given in the table below.  You are free to 
add more modifiers that might be helpful for furhtor custom postprocessing
of the output code.

+-------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------+

+-------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------+

The keyword *baseline* is only necessary when you are using a training
based baseline detection (option *-tb* of `psaltiki_recognize.py`__). On
the other hand it does no harm in other baseline detection methods, so 
you can train it anyway.

.. __: #psaltiki-recognize-py

Neume Grouping
--------------

Broken Symbols
++++++++++++++

Gamera allows the training of symbols that are broken into more than
one component due to printing defects. It requires that you mark the
respective parts with a rectangle in the image view of the training
GUI and classify them with the prefix ``_group.`` followed by the
regular symbol name. See the Gamera training tutorial for details.

.. note:: Training of broken symbols is generally not necessary, when
          there are still enough non broken versions of the same
          symbol in the training images.


Neume Combinations
++++++++++++++++++

Theoretically the method for training broken symbols is also applicable
to symbols purposely broken like the *kendimata* combination consisting
of two *kendimas*. This requires however that the combination is always 
*very* similar, a condition rarely fulfilled in psaltiki prints. Moreover
the direkt training of neume groups slows down the training process
considerably.

Hence the toolkit offers a different way for identifying neume combinations,
that is applied *after* the recognition of the individual neumes. It is
controled by a simple text file (provided by the user) consisting of
lines of the following form:

    ``neume1,neume2,dist: neume3``

This means that the adjacent neumes *neume1* and *neume2* following each
other in the horizontal direction with a bounding box distance of at most 
*dist* oligon_heights are to be replaced with the single symbol *neume3*.
This file needs to be given to `psaltiki_recogize.py`__ with the option
*-g*.

.. __: #psaltiki-recognize-py

When you are using the default symbol table, the file will typically
look like::

    kendima,kendima,1.0: primary.kendimata
    secondaryright.bareia,hapli,2.0: primary.leima-chronou
    primary.apostrophos,primary.elaphron,1.2: primary.syneches-elphron


Recognition
'''''''''''

The recognition is not done interactively, but from the command line (shell,
DOS prompt) with the command *psaltiki_recognize.py*. This allows for
processing a whole batch of images without user interactions.

Before you can use *psaltiki_recognize.py*, make sure that it can be found
by your shell with the following command:

   ``psaltiki_recognize.py -?``

If you get a "command not found" error you must add the directory into which
*psaltiki_recognize.py* has been installed to your ``PATH`` environment
variable (replace 2.3 with your actual python version, if necessary):

  - on Windows this is the *Scripts* subdirectory of your python install
    directory, e.g. *D:\\Python23\\Scripts*
  - on MacOS X it is 
    */System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/bin*


psaltiki_recognize.py
---------------------

*psaltiki_recognize* takes a psaltiki image and a training data file as input
and creates an encoding of the chant as output. For a full list 
of possible command line options with an explanation, call 
``psaltiki_recognize -?``.

Here is a description of the most important options:

``-d`` *file.xml*
    training data file in xml format. When you have used some
    preprocessing options on the training data make sure that
    you apply the same to the input of psaltikit_recognize with
    the options *-smooth* etc.

``-g`` *file.txt*
    file containing the grouping information as described in section
    `Neume Combinations`__. When omitted no, grouping (except for
    correcting broken characters) is done.

.. __: usermanual.html#neume-combinations

``-smooth``, ``-smoothopt``, ``-rotate``, ``-border``
    preprocessing options for smoothing, rotation correction and copy border
    removal

``-o`` *outfile*
    write chant encoding to *outfile*

``-t`` *file.txt*
    additionally write a text file listing all recognized neumes and
    their position (useful for groundtruthing). It uses the function
    `PsaltikiNeumes::get_txt_output()`__

.. __: gamera.toolkits.psaltiki.psaltiki_neumes.PsaltikiNeumes.html#get-txt-output

``-tb``
    only use the neumes trained as baseline defining neumes for detecting
    the baselines. In general this option is not necessary.

``-k`` *k*
    value of *k* in the kNN classifier. Note that a larger value of *k*
    requires more training symbols.

``-debug`` *n*
    debug level. When *n* > 0, progress information are given, when
    *n* > 1 additional images with the prefix *debug-* are written to
    the current directory


The Output Code
---------------

The output file written by *psaltiki_recognize.py* is a human readable
text file where each line represents a line of neume groups in the
input image. The neume groups are encoded as follows:

 - Groups are enclosed in parentheses.
 - Neumes within a group are separated by semicolons.
 - Neume groups are separated by spaces. 
 - Neume names are kept as they are trained, except for the keywords
   *baseline* and *primary* which are chopped off.
 - When a group contains a primary neume, it is marked with the prefix 
   *primary.* (including the final period). Martyria and chronos groups 
   are identifiable as groups containing martyria scale or chronos neumes;
   their prefixes (*martyria.* or *chronos*) are kept in the output. 
 - Coordinates are appended to the neume name in square brackets 
   ``[x,y]``

The neume coordinates are not absolute coordinates on the entire page
but with respect to the primary (or martyria or chronos) neume of each
group in the following coordinate system:

 - *y* = 0 on the baseline, *x* = 0 at the right edge of the primary 
   neume bounding box
 - the grid unit size is the Oligon height
 - the given coordinate is the position of the lower right edge of the
   neume bounding box, except for Gorgons, where the leftmost lower 
   edge is used. Note that this results in mostly negative *x*-coordinates. 

Here are some examples for the output code of single neume groups:

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Image of Neume Group**          | **Output Code**                                                      |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. image:: images/neumegroup1.png | ``(primary.oligon[0,0];kendimata[-3,2];gorgon.mono-gorgon[-5,3])``   |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. image:: images/neumegroup2.png | ``(primary.oligon[0,0];linking.heteron[-5,-3];apostrophos[-6,2];``   |
|                                   | ``kendimata[-2,2];gorgon.mono-gorgon[-4,4])``                        |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. image:: images/neumegroup3.png | ``(martyria.diatonic-hemi-phi[0,-6];letter.small.pa[0,0])``          |
+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+


Visualization
'''''''''''''

There are two options to cross check the recognition visually for debugging
or evaluation purposes:

 - debug images written by *psaltiki_recognize.py*
 - an interactive session with the Gamera GUI


Debug Images
------------

With the option *-debug 2*, *psaltiki_recognize.py* writes the following
images to the current working directory:

``debug_groups.png``
    Neumes belonging to the same group are highlighted
    in the same color.

``debug_neumes.png``
    Neumes recognized as beloning to the same class
    (i.e. they have the same symbol name) are highlighted with the
    same color.

``debug_neumes_combinations.png``
    Neumes grouped as `Neume Combinations`__ are marked red.

.. __: #neume-combinations

``debug_baselines.png``
    Neumes used for baseline detection are hightlighted
    and the resulting baselines shown.

``debug_characteristic_dimensions.png``
    Shows where the two dimensions *oligon_height* and
    *oligon_width* have been detected on the page. See 
    `PsaltikiPage::mark_characteristic_dimensions`__.

.. __: gamera.toolkits.psaltiki.psaltiki_page.PsaltikiPage.html#mark-characteristic-dimensions


In the Gamera GUI
-----------------

Both baseline detection and the measurement of the characteristic dimensions
can be visualized from the Gamera GUI as follows:

 - import the Psaltiki toolkit with
   *Toolkits/psaltiki/Import 'psaltiki' toolkit*
 - load an image file, convert it to onebit with *Conversion/to_onebit*
   and optionally apply some preprocessing methods from the *Psaltiki*
   right click menu
 - right click on the image icon and select
   *Psaltiki/Create_PsaltikiPage*

From the right click menu you can inspect the characteristic dimensions
and the baselines.
