Changelog for Gamera Psaltiki Toolkit
=====================================

TODO - revise symbol table again to include letter.ison.*
       as described in GKM's email from 08.03.2007

Version 1.1.2, Feb 17 2010:
---------------------------

 - replaced script 'makedist' with distutils 'sdist' mechanism

 - added preprocessing options in "Create PsaltikiPage"
   from toolkit icon context menu


Version 1.1.1, Apr 17 2009:
---------------------------

 - choosing files from icon context menu now also works on Windows


Version 1.1.0, Mar 14 2008:
---------------------------

 - ported to wxPython 2.8

 - automatic grouping corrected when compund neumes overlap
   considerably in the x-direction

 - glyphs that lie "far away" in the y-direction now removed
   from neume groups (new function PsaltikiNeumes::remove_outliers)

 - removed keyword "primary" from all but one neume, when
   more than one neumes classified as "primary.*" are in
   the same group

 - fixed an error in training based lyrics removal

 - check option "remove copy border" in preprocess dialog now works

 - baseline detection improved; now also works with only one baseline


Version 1.0.6, Mar 06 2007:
---------------------------

 - "tempo" keyword changed to "chronos"

 - default symbol table revised

 - y-positions in output code now with positive values above
   the baseline rather than below the baseline


Version 1.0.5, Mar 02 2007:
---------------------------

 - option for lyrics removal in training session added

 - more control over smoothing options in plugins and training
   session

 - added a GUI (psaltiki_gui) for simplifying the call of
   the recognition script. This is however prelimary and not
   documented


Version 1.0.4, Dec 14 2006:
---------------------------

 - smoothing now defaults to rank(5) (median filter)
   rather than closing, because closing glues too many
   neumes together that should remain separated


Version 1.0.3, Dec 07 2006:
---------------------------

 - new modifier "martyria-fthora" for neumes that can be both
   martyria or belong to a primary neume as fthora


Version 1.0.2, Nov 29 2006:
---------------------------

 - new option -w in psaltiki_recognize.py for loading
   feature weights as generated by Biollante

 - new modifier keyword "secondaryright" for neume names
   indicating a secondary neume that always belongs to the
   group to its right rather than to its left (the latter 
   is the default). bareia in the default symbol table is now
   "secondaryright.bareia"

 - PsaltikiNeumes.get_txt_output() now also prints the group
   number


Version 1.0.1, Nov 24 2006:
---------------------------

 - corrections in martyrias handling:
    o always attached to the baseline above them
    o form their own group even when overlapping
      with a primary neume on the baseline


Version 1.0.0, Nov 22 2006:
---------------------------

 - first creation
